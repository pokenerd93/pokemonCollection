# pokemonCollection
Python program designed to track sets and completion status

Currently in progress to add all sets with updates later for more features. This is a hobby project and don't expect it to be perfect, but just having a little fun and incorporating coding and pokemon. I'd like to do one for each tcg in the future. Right now we are using the pokemontcg.io as a base line and hoping to incorporate a new data option in the future.
